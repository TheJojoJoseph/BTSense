               BTSense is a full stack IoT platform based on ESP8266 WiFi SoC. It is primarily designed for prototyping & pre-production testing. It runs a small webserver using spritetm/esphttpd using which it can be connected to the local WiFi. The firmware is being developed to support multiple sensors in plug & play model. To support plug & play, BTSense interfaces pluggable daughter boards called bridgeboards which has slots defined for the supported sensors.
